## Definition 

**SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol)** is a protocol used for managing and monitoring devices on a network. It allows network administrators to collect information about devices and their status and to configure devices remotely.

SNMP operates in a client-server model, where:

- The **SNMP manager** is the client, responsible for querying and configuring devices.
- The **SNMP agents** are servers running on network devices (e.g., routers, switches, servers, printers) that provide information to the manager.

SNMP uses [[Management Information Base (MIB)]], which are structured databases defining the parameters and metrics (e.g., CPU usage, memory usage, network throughput) that can be monitored or configured.
