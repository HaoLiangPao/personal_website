## Definition 

PTF (Program Temporary Fix)

A PTF is the actual fix or patch that addresses the problem reported in an APAR. It is essentially a piece of code or a set of instructions that modifies the software to resolve the identified issue.

*Usually used in [[Operating System#Enterprise Systems]]*

## Purpose:

- To deliver a solution for the problem documented in an [[APAR]].
- To provide a mechanism for customers to update their systems with the latest fixes.

## Process:

1. After an APAR is reviewed and a solution is developed, it is packaged as a PTF.
2. The PTF is distributed to customers to apply to their systems.
3. The PTF may be tested and bundled into future updates or service packs.
