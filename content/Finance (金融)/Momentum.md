## Definition

Momentum measures **the rate of price changes** over a given lookback period, which changes in the same extend as the original price. It is often been interpreted as an indicator of the strength of a trend.

**The Momentum is calculated as:**
$$
Momentum(t) = P(t) - P(t - N)
$$
where $P(t)$ is the price at time $t$, and $N$ is the lookback period.
