## Definition

A **bull market** or a **bullish position** on a stock is an optimistic viewpoint that implies that things will continue to grow. On the other hand, a bear market or a bearish position is pessimistic (or cautionary, or realistic, depending on how you see the glass) about the future of an asset.

大家都喜欢牛市，当股票市场处于牛市中的时候，大部分股票上涨，经济形势好，老百姓赚钱，其乐融融。（但也要警惕随之而来的熊市，要做好风险控制）
