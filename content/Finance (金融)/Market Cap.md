## Definition

**Market cap** is a metric of a stock’s total shares times its price. It’s worth noting that the price of a stock has no relation to the value of a company; it only describes the cost of owning a single share in that company.

*If you can afford the market cap of a company, you can afford to buy the company in its entirety and take over its ownership.*
