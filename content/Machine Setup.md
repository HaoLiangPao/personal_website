## Definition 

Commercial laptops are not set up for developers by default. Also every developers are different. You will need to set it up the way works the best for you.

The steps, notes I kept below are something I would like to redo whenever I got a new laptop to setup (usually mac as the personal work station)

## ⚠️ Pre-requisites
### Package Manager
- [ ] [[Package Manager#Brew]] 
- [ ] [[Package Manager#NPM]]
- [ ] [[Package Manager#Pipx]]
- [ ] [[Package Manager#Cargo]]
- [ ] [[Package Manager#Basher]]


## Terminal & Shell Setup
- [ ] [Install FiraCode Nerd Font](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts) - Terminal Font (Download Fira Code and Fira Mono from the release page, then drag and drop them into Font Book)
- [ ] [[Terminal#ZSH]] - [[Terminal#Shell]]
- [ ] [[Terminal#iterm2]] - [[Terminal]]
- [ ] [[Terminal#Termius]] - Terminal
- [ ] [[Terminal#ohmyzsh]] - [[Terminal#Shell Enhancement]]



##  Code Editor
### VSCode
### NeoVim
1. There is a very good vim tutorial enclosed in the NeoVim Tutorial
2. A very detailed youtube video explaining all the thing you need to know to get started.

**Benefits comparing with the VSCode**:
1. Better cross-platform feature (I personally switched to this for this reason)
2. Faster
3. More configurable (you can create your own key-map with `lua` scripts.)

A good way to switch from **VSCode** to **NeoVim** is that enable vim/neovim in your VSCode first, so that you are familiar with the whole *Vim* world. Once you are used to the feeling of just have hands on the keyboard without moving cursors, you would probably start thingking: "What if I can replace the *mouse movement* *click actions* etc. into keyboards entries" too.

The switch is a big change, so just start to gradually use vim for now, don't ever try to build Rome within one day.
