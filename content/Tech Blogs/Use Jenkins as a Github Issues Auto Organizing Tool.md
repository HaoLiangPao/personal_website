## Pain Point
If you are using a self-hosted, enterprise version of Github, you might not have the privilege to automatically modify the issues at your most convenience. For example, our life will be easier if:
- Issues status can be automatically changing from `NEW` to `IN PROGRESS` to `DONE`.
- Tags will be automatically added (following some rules if needed)
- Metrics can be automatically calculated...

The biggest issue we were facing was the sunset of **Zenhub** and we need to manage our issues with Github Projects which is still at a relatively old version. (some of the features introduced in the below were added in the newest version of Github Project)


## Solution
As mentioned in the previous section, this solution can be considered as a temporary solution (however, if it fits your need, it could be a ultimate solution if the sprint planning requirements remain the same).

However, it does have some benefits as it is highly customizable, if you want certain tag to trigger a bunch of customized monitoring process, it can be defined here.

It is still a naive project as not much time was invested on it, re-design might be done to make it more efficient and easier to maintain.
