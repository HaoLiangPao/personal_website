## Hi! It's Hao here 👋

Welcome to my digital garden, here is where I put my distilled knowledge. I like reading, researching and trying out new things. Although there are a lot of time wasted and many failures, but I do captured some valuation thoughts that I believe to be worth sharing.

If you accidentally dropped by, please walk around and see if you find anything interesting. You can find my contact information down below, don't be afraid to knock on my "door" :)
